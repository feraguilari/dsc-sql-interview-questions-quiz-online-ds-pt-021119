    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll go through a short quiz containing the types of questions about SQL and relational databases that you can expect to see in an interview. \n",

    "## SQL Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "what are the 5 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\n",
    "1. NULL. The value is a NULL value.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. INTEGER. The value is a signed integer, stored in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes depending on the magnitude of the value.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. REAL. The value is a floating point value, stored as an 8-byte IEEE floating point number.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TEXT. The value is a text string, stored using the database encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. BLOB. The value is a blob of data, stored exactly as it was input.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean is stores as INTEGER with 0 or 1 value. Date and Time Datatype can be sroes as as TEXT, REAL, or INTEGER values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\n",
    "1. Primary key is the id for each row in each table.<br>\n",
    "2. SQL foreign key constraints are used to enforce \"exists\" relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\n",
    "1. One To Many relationship: One record in a table is linked to a single other record in another table.\n",
    "2. One To One relationship: On record in a table is linked to seleveral records in another table.\n",
    "3. Many To Many relationship: This is a more complex relationship since many records in one table are linked to many records in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\n",
    "1. INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables\n",
    "2. LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table\n",
    "3. RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table\n",
    "4. FULL JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\n",
    "* The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result-set by one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\n",
    "* An Associative Entity must be used in order to handle a JOIN between two tables with a many-to-many relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
